# Continuous Integration workflow for testing the project
# This workflow ensures the code works across different Python versions

on:
  push  # Run on every push to the repository
  #schedule:
  #  - cron: "0 */2 * * *"  # Uncomment to run every 2 hours (useful for dependency updates)

    # The type of runner that the job will run on (from matrix strategy)
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    # Matrix strategy allows testing across multiple configurations
