"""Marimo notebook demonstrating the hierarchical 1/N portfolio allocation strategy.

This notebook implements a hierarchical version of the 1/N portfolio allocation strategy,
inspired by Thomas Raffinot. It builds a dendrogram using the 'ward' distance method
and applies the 1/N strategy level by level, from the root to the leaves.
